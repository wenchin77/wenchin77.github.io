Hi, I'm Wen, a Product Manager with a background in software engineering. I specialize in developing software solutions and leading cross-functional teams to create impactful digital experiences.

With experience at Shopee, 91APP, and lablaco, a circular fashion startup, I’ve honed my skills in category management, software development, and product management. My journey from software engineer to product manager has given me a unique perspective on creating solutions that drive business outcomes.

I’m adept at remote work, having successfully managed projects and asynchronous communications within global teams for over two years.

Outside of work, I’m passionate about surfing and calligraphy, which help me find balance and focus. I bring the same dedication to my professional life, always striving for flow and fulfillment.

My mission is to bridge the gap between technology and human experiences, building products that not only solve problems but also inspire and engage people. I’m committed to pushing the boundaries of what’s possible, whether in digital product development or creative endeavors, all while striving to make the world a better place.

I’m always open to new opportunities and collaborations. If you’d like to connect, discuss potential projects, or just chat about technology and creativity, eel free to check out [my projects](https://wenchin77.github.io/projects/) or [reach out](https://wenchin77.github.io/contact/) !
