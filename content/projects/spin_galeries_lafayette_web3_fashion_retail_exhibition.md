### Project Overview
The Spin x Galeries Lafayette Web3 fashion retail exhibition was a groundbreaking event that merged fashion, technology, and retail, creating an immersive Web3 experience at Galeries Lafayette Champs-Élysées. This exhibition showcased an innovative fusion of Web3 technology and fashion, incorporating augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and NFTs to create a unique retail experience.

### My Role
As a Product Manager, I played a pivotal role in bringing this visionary project to life. My responsibilities included:
- **Digitization of Garments**: Worked closely with designers and 3D artists to digitize physical garments, creating high-fidelity digital replicas for the virtual showcase. This involved translating intricate design details into 3D models and ensuring they were accurately represented in the virtual space.
- **VR Space Rendering**: Coordinated with a 3D artist to render the entrance of Galeries Lafayette Champs-Élysées in VR, creating an immersive virtual representation of the exhibition space.
- **NFT Integration**: Collaborated with software engineers to mint NFTs on the Flow blockchain, enabling a "phygital" experience where customers could access and trace garments both online and offline. This integration allowed visitors to interact with digital fashion assets and ensure transparency and traceability on the blockchain.
- **Coordination**: Managed internal and external collaboration between designers, engineers and commercial team to ensure seamless integration of digital assets. This coordination was crucial in aligning the creative vision with the technical requirements of the Web3 platform.

### Impact and Results
The exhibition was recognized as one of the largest meta-retail events to date, drawing significant media attention and industry acclaim. It successfully demonstrated the potential of Web3 technologies in transforming the fashion retail landscape.
- **Attendance**: Attracted 230,000 visitors to Galeries Lafayette over a three-week period, significantly boosting foot traffic and engagement.
- **Media Coverage**: Featured in [Vogue](https://vogue.ph/lifestyle/events/how-spin-made-the-biggest-meta-retail-event-to-date/), [CFS Media](https://cfs.media/articles/spin-cfs-galeries-lafayette-web3-fashion-retail-exhibition), and [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/04/lablaco-seeks-to-help-usher-in-the-new-era-of-web3-digitized-retail/), reaching a broad audience.
- **NFT Adoption**: 99% of NFT purchasers had never owned an NFT before, showcasing the event’s success in introducing new audiences to digital assets. The remaining 1% comprised industry professionals invited to the event.
- **Social Media Engagement**: Generated considerable social media interactions, including likes, shares, and comments, amplifying the event’s visibility and impact.
