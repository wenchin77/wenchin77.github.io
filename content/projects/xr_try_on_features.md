### Project Overview 
The XR (Extended Reality) Try-On feature was an innovative step towards integrating immersive technology into the fashion retail experience. Spread across SPIN’s website and VR app, this feature allowed users to virtually try on garments using both VR (Virtual Reality) and AR (Augmented Reality) technologies. By providing a seamless and interactive shopping experience, XR Try-On bridged the gap between digital and physical fashion, offering users a unique way to engage with fashion in real-time.

### My Role
As the Product Manager overseeing the XR Try-On feature, I played a key role in delivering both VR and AR try-on experiences across the SPIN platforms:

#### 1. VR Try-On (SPIN VR App on Meta Quest):
- **Specification Definition & Coordination**: I acted as the liaison between the commercial teams and 3D engineers, defining the specifications and scope for fitting digital garments onto avatars in the VR environment.
- **Testing & Feedback**: After the initial renders were created, I conducted thorough testing to ensure accuracy. If any rendering issues were identified, I communicated directly with 3D designers for necessary adjustments.
- **Release Management**: Once testing was completed, I facilitated the release of the upgraded versions onto the SPIN VR platform, ensuring that users could seamlessly experience the try-on feature in the VR space.

#### 2. AR Try-On (SPIN Website):
- **Research & Partnership**: I researched various methods for implementing AR on web platforms and ultimately partnered with Snapchat to develop custom AR filters for SPIN.
- **Coordination & Development**: I coordinated closely with 3D engineers and web engineers to integrate AR try-on features into our website. This included ensuring that users could see real-time effects of wearing digital garments within their own environments.
- **UX Design & Mockups**: To streamline the development process, I created mockup UI designs, helping web engineers understand how the AR user experience should be built to maximize user engagement and satisfaction.

### Impact and Results
- **User Engagement**: The XR Try-On feature was highly successful, with a great amount of AR try-ons recorded across events. The VR try-on feature also saw significant use during key fashion events, enhancing the user experience.
- **Platform Expansion**: The AR try-on feature added a new dimension to the SPIN website, attracting a broader audience and increasing the platform’s interactivity and appeal.
- **Industry Recognition**: The successful implementation of XR Try-On features across SPIN platforms was praised in the industry, further establishing SPIN as a leader in digital fashion innovation.

### Reflection and Learnings
Managing the development and deployment of XR Try-On features across SPIN platforms was a challenging yet rewarding experience. The project required a deep understanding of both VR and AR technologies, as well as effective coordination between diverse teams. The successful delivery of these features demonstrated the importance of clear communication, rigorous testing, and user-focused design. This project not only enhanced the SPIN platforms but also solidified my expertise in managing complex, tech-driven initiatives in the fashion industry.
