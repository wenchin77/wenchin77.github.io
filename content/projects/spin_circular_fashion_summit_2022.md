### Project Overview
The SPIN Circular Fashion Summit 2022 was a groundbreaking event that fused fashion, technology, and sustainability in the virtual realm. Hosted within the SPIN metaverse, a VR platform accessible via Meta Quest, this summit brought together fashion industry leaders and enthusiasts to explore the future of circular fashion. The event featured four interactive galleries, curated by renowned partners including Fondazione Sozzani, ISKO, Galeries Lafayette, and Vogue Philippines. The galleries showcased a range of digital and phygital assets, from Franca Sozzani’s vintage couture archive to Takashi Murakami’s artwork, alongside wearable NFTs.

### My Role

- **SPIN Metaverse Setup**: Led the setup of the partner content within the SPIN metaverse, including galleries, designer hubs, a VIP area, and more. This involved coordinating with partners to ensure their content was accurately represented and aligned with the summit's theme.
- **User Experience Management**: Oversaw the user experience within the SPIN metaverse, focusing on key features like avatar interaction, speaker sessions, and photo-taking and sharing capabilities. My goal was to ensure that every fashion guest had a memorable and immersive experience.
- **Project Management**: Ensured that timelines were met and tracked the progress of development and testing. This included prioritizing tasks, coordinating cross-functional teams, and addressing any challenges that arose to keep the project on schedule and within scope.

### Impact and Results

### Reflection and Learnings
Having contributed to the SPIN Circular Fashion Summit for two consecutive years, I've gained invaluable insights into the intersection of fashion, technology, and sustainability. The 2022 summit presented unique challenges and opportunities as we expanded our digital capabilities and brought even more partners on board. This experience honed my skills in project management, cross-functional team coordination, and delivering immersive digital experiences. It was particularly rewarding to see the evolution of the summit from its first iteration to this more complex and expansive event, reinforcing my belief in the transformative potential of Web3 and VR technologies in fashion. Each summit has taught me the importance of adaptability, meticulous planning, and the power of collaboration in bringing innovative ideas to life.
