Hi, I'm Wen, a Product Manager with a background in software engineering. I specialize in developing software solutions and leading cross-functional teams to create impactful digital experiences.

With experience at leading companies like Shopee and 91APP, I’ve honed my skills in category management, software development, and project leadership. At lablaco, a circular fashion startup, I managed the development of cutting-edge Web3 fashion retail experiences, including the meta-retail exhibition at Galeries Lafayette, which showcased the future of fashion and technology. My journey from software engineer to product manager has given me a unique perspective on building solutions that drive business outcomes.

My expertise lies in product management, software engineering, and developing innovative digital products. I’m particularly skilled in creating seamless user experiences, managing complex projects, and leveraging emerging technologies to push boundaries in digital transformation.

Outside of work, I’m passionate about surfing and calligraphy. These activities help me relax and focus, providing a balance to my professional life. I bring the same dedication and attention to detail in both my personal interests and my work, always striving for a sense of flow and fulfillment in everything I do.

My mission is to bridge the gap between technology and human experiences, creating products that not only solve problems but also inspire and engage users. I’m committed to pushing the boundaries of what’s possible, whether in digital product development or creative endeavors.

I’m always open to new opportunities and collaborations. If you’d like to connect, discuss potential projects, or just chat about technology and creativity, feel free to reach out!
